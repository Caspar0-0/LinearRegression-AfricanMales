# Regression and ML Project
This project studies a government dataset and answers research questions:
1. Do African American males have statistically different wages compared to Caucasian males?
2. Do African American males have statistically different wages compared to all other males?
The goal of this case study is to come up with a linear regression model that incorporates all relevant variables, interactions
and functional forms of the covariates, and thus test the two research questions above. In the end, diagnostics and model validation are analyzed.
It Initially split the data set up into a model building data set and a model validation dataset. Use the model building data set to construct your model and use the model validation for validation. When validating the model, it compares mean square prediction error to MSE.
